Hey There! I'm Eric! 
  
  I am currently a 3rd year student at California State Polytechnic Pomona majoring in computer engineering.  
  I was first intoduced to the idea of computer engineering when a "steering and suspension" automotive class was canceled and the college I was in offered another class. 
  In the class it would cover the basics of electrical cicuits, programming, welding, soldering, and computer numeral control. The goal of the class was to build a 
  vehicle operated by a microcontroller from sctrach. After I took a break from school to work at a minimum wage job for personal reasons. I found the repetitve aspect of the job 
  painfully dull and dreamt of ways to automate the workload. From there I would dream of other things I could automate. The thought of automating menial tasks around the house and combining household items with 
  tech would quickly send me in a frenzy on designing the projects. Thats when I knew that this was the career path I wanted.
